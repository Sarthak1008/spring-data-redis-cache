Spring Data Redis provides easy integration with Redis, a popular open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. When combined with Spring Boot, it offers seamless configuration and integration with Spring-based applications.

Purpose: The primary purpose of integrating Spring Data Redis is to leverage Redis as a cache store to improve the performance of the application by reducing the response time for frequently accessed data.
